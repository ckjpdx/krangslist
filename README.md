## Behavior Specifications

- [ ] As a user, I want to see all of the categories on the main page.

- [ ] As a user, I want to click a category to navigate to a page with all its listings.

- [ ] As a user, I want to click a listing to see its contents (For now just hide/show listing details. Routing to a page for a specific listing requires concepts from tonight's homework).

- [ ] As a user, I want to click on a listing to view its details.

- [ ] As a user, I want to add a new listing to a category of my choosing.

- [ ] As a user, I want the option to update my listing, if I need to.

- [ ] As a user, I want the option to delete my listing if I no longer need it.

## Further Exploration

- [ ] As a user, I want to "favorite" listings I like, and view my favorites later.

- [ ] As a user, I want my listings to automatically be assigned a timestamp. And I want to see when other listings were posted, too. (Hint: Check out some of Angular's built-in pipes!)
